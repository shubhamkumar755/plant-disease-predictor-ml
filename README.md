# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Web App

This project is a deep learning-powered web application that predicts **plant diseases** from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Hosted on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), it provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers, researchers, and hobbyists to identify plant issues with a single image.
